# enhance-workflow

Continue implementing the enhanced prompt workflow with Constitutional AI, Shared Evaluation, and Template Library.

## Usage

Run `/enhance-workflow` to continue the implementation from where it left off.

## What This Command Does

This command helps implement the enhanced prompt workflow system by:
1. Checking the current implementation state
2. Running tests for completed phases
3. Continuing with the next implementation step
4. Tracking progress and maintaining state

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & Safety Setup
- Create feature branch
- Set up parallel file structure
- Create implementation tracking

### Phase 1: Constitutional AI Layer
- Create ConstitutionalValidator class
- Integrate with enhanced workflow
- Add safety rule management

### Phase 2: Shared Evaluation Framework
- Extend evaluation engine
- Integrate quality assessment
- Build evaluation dashboard

### Phase 3: Template Library
- Create template system
- Integrate hybrid approach
- Build template management UI

### Phase 4: Improve Workflow Integration
- Create improve workflow variant
- Unify workflow infrastructure
- Build improve workflow UI

### Phase 5: Real-time Feedback & Testing
- Implement feedback system
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Production readiness validation

## State Management

The implementation state is tracked in:
- `.claude/implementation-state.json` - Current progress
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Detailed documentation
- Test results in `src/ai/tests/enhanced-workflow/`

## Safety

- All work happens in `feature/enhanced-prompt-workflow` branch
- Main branch remains untouched
- Comprehensive tests at each phase
- Easy rollback by switching branches

## Commands

The system will:
1. Check current git branch (create feature branch if needed)
2. Load implementation state
3. Run validation tests for completed work
4. Continue with next uncompleted task
5. Update state after each successful step
6. Provide clear progress updates

## Recovery

If implementation is interrupted:
- State is preserved in `.claude/implementation-state.json`
- Tests validate all completed work
- Implementation resumes from last successful step
- No work is lost or duplicated
